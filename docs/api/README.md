# Welcome to the API Docs!

Welcome to the documentation section of the raiderRide project.
To get started, you can view the modules in [this section](modules.md) of the docs!

Every module is auto generated from the TSDoc comments in front of various functions and types, and this document can be regenerated by running: `yarn run docs`

## Happy coding 🎉🙌
