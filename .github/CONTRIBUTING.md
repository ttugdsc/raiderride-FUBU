# How can I participate?

Here you can watch and even participate in the development on the TTU GDSC RaiderRide project. Hopefully it becomes something tangible in the future, until then, its a fun lil ridesharing project.

## Guidelines

Super basic stuff, we have templates in place and video tutoriasl so no stress. If you have questions as well, always feel free to reach out!

## Issues available for community contribution:

- You'll see a `help wanted` tag on features that we're looking to add
- You don't need our permission to work on one of these issues
- Feel free to colaborate with others already working on an issue
- Keep commits thoughtful, messages should be brief but consice

If you want to try and tackle one of these issues you would fork the repository and follow any guides found in the [Readme](../README.md).

## Member proposed issues

If you feel like there's a feature that the website should definitely have then bring you would follow these steps

1. Create an issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/ttugdsc/raiderRide-FUBU/issues) of the repo.
2. A maintainer will greenlight you or ask for clarification.

**We will not be accepting pull requests without accompanying issues.**

Issue template: (Which you'll have access to select when you click new issue)

**(feat/bug/power-up) _Name of feature_**

**Description**
Here you'll explain what feature want to add, what bug you've found, or what enhancement you want to make to what's already built.

**Alternatives**
Any hypothetical other routes you can take if plan A is impossible or just not feasible

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

## Issues not available for community contribution:

These issues will be marked `ðŸ”’ staff only`.
`ðŸ”’ staff only` issues require infrastructure access or institutional knowledge that would be impractical to provide to the community, think api keys or continuous integration changes.

## Issues not ready for work:

- `ðŸš§ status: blocked` Blocked by other work that needs to be done first
- `ðŸ§¹ status: ticket work required`: Needs additional work before it is ready to be taken up
- `ðŸš¦ status: awaiting triage`: Has not been triaged by a maintainer

## Asking for help

Don't be afraid to ask for help when you're lost, that's literally the point of this community. :)
Ask your questions in the issue you're working on or into the discussion section if there's no attached issue.

Here's a lil video too on [how to contribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-GXViaI4tI).

### Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ and welcome to the TTU GDSC
